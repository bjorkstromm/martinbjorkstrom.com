So it has finally come to this. After procrastinating for a while now I've finally decided to setup a blog. The blog is a static site generated by [Wyam](https://wyam.io/) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). You can find the source code for this blog [here](https://github.com/mholo65/mholo65).

I have lots and lots of interesting stuff I would like to blog about, some will happen and some will not. Because like most people, I'm also short on hours per day to spend on spare time tinkering. A couple of things that's in the pipeline though is:
* [Depends](https://github.com/mholo65/depends), a command line dependency explorer for .NET powered by [Buildalyzer](https://github.com/daveaglick/Buildalyzer) and [gui.cs](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/gui.cs).
* [Cake (C# Make)](https://cakebuild.net/), as some of you know, a lot of my spare time coding goes into Cake. My contributions are mostly concentrated in the Roslyn, NuGet, and tooling area. Maybe a deep dive in how Cake uses the [NuGet.Client](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/) libraries for installing addins and tools?
* [OmniSharp](http://www.omnisharp.net/), as some of you know, one of the reasons why I was invited as Cake maintainer was that I was working on intellisense support for `.cake` files in OmniSharp. I've been thinking about a three part blog series where I explain what is what, and how it all ties together in order to support intellisense for Cake.
* [Service Fabric](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/), microservices development and application lifecycle management done right. This is a really cool, open source, distributed systems platform from Microsoft that makes it easy to package, deploy, and manage scalable and reliable microservices and containers.

So, now that you know what's coming, subscribe to the feed below or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mholo65) to stay updated.
